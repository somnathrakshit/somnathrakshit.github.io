      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google Photos album containing the images is present &lt;a href=&#34;https://photos.app.goo.gl/GmeSraqqvKPxu7Zb6&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implemented the neural style transfer algortihm implemented by Gatys et al. (2016) in PyTorch. This technique allows us to take an input image and perform its reproduction in a new artistic style. This algorithm takes two images as inputs. One is the style image that contains the artistic style whereas the other image contains the content which is to be modified in the given artistic style.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/project/geograpy3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;geograpy3 is a fork of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Corollarium/geograpy2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Geograpy2&lt;/a&gt;, which is itself a fork of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ushahidi/geograpy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;geograpy&lt;/a&gt; and inherits most of it, but solves several problems (such as support for utf8, places names with multiple words, confusion over homonyms etc). Also, geograpy3 is compatible with Python 3, unlike Geography2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is installable from PyPi by running the following command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install geograpy3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Detection and Localisation of Diabetic Retinopathy</title>
      <link>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/project/fundus-image-localization/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQpi7z7g1swVv-bcG2GeYggnhCjL1zXOq3BJYMXnqGtJC6pVg7Iq7qr-4bODfVGEcngX9PGiuJ5P8Qs/pub?start=false&amp;amp;loop=false&amp;amp;delayms=15000&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Slides&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://somnathrakshit.github.io/files/download/project_report_jgec.pdf&#34;&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diabetic retinopathy occurs when the retina is damaged because fluids leak from blood vessels into the retina. The presence of hemorrhage is one of the earliest signs to indicate the severity of the disease. In this paper we review techniques, algorithms and methodologies used for the detection of hemorrhage from diabetic retinopathy retinal images. The retina is a transparent layer of vascularized neural tissue lining the inner layer of the back wall of the eye, between the retinal pigment epithelium on the outer and the vitreous on the inner side. The retina captures photons and converts these two photochemical and electrical energy integrates the Signals and transmits the resultant signal to the visual cortex of the brain via the optic nerve tracts and radiations. The retinal architecture is lamellar. Within this there are major types performing sensory nutritional regulatory immunomodulatory and structure and functions. The retina is uniquely partitioned from the vascular system by the blood retinal barrier and blood aqueous barrier. The blood supply is dual to the inner retina it is by the retinal circulation lying within the in a retina and to the outer retina it is by the choroidal circulation, Hrithik vascular layer lying outside of the retinal pigment epithelium. The retinal pigment epithelium and the choroid are critical to retinal function. Is the eye is imagined to be a camera in the retina is the film. Just like a picture cannot be developed if the camera has defective film, vision is not possible in an eye with a defective retina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If caught early then diabetic retinopathy can be treated, otherwise it can lead to irreversible blindness. Unluckily, medical specialists capable of detecting the disease are not available in many parts of the world where diabetes is prevalent. Deep neural networks have helped in solving many such problems in the recent past. Medical image classification has been done accurately using deep neural networks and thus, we will be using this in our project. The aim of this project is to use deep learning to help doctors identify the patients in need, particularly among underserved populations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prolonged diabetes leads to DR, where the retina is damaged due to fluid leaking from the blood vessels. Usually, the stage of DR is judged based on blood vessels, exudes, hemorrhages, microaneurysms and texture. In this paper, we have discussed different methods for features extraction and automatic DR stage detection. An ophthalmologist uses an ophthalmoscope to visualize the blood vessels and his or her brain to detect the DR stages. Recently digital imaging became available as a tool for DR screening. It provides high quality permanent records of the retinal appearance, which can be used for monitoring of progression or response to treatment, and which can be reviewed by an ophthalmologist, digital images have the potential to be processed by automatic analysis systems. A combination of both accurate and early diagnosis as well as correct application of treatment can prevent blindness caused by DR in more than 50% of all cases. Therefore, regular screenings for DR of patients with diabetes is important. The grading of the resultant fundus images is an important cost factor. Automated DR detection can reduce the grading cost and thereby make the whole screening process less expensive. Some of the algorithms and systems reviewed in this paper are close to achieve DR identification in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Piezoelectric Transducer and Arduino Based Wirelessly Controlled Energy Saving Scheme for Street Lights</title>
      <link>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/project/energy-saving-scheme-street-lights/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2018 03:19:01 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/project/energy-saving-scheme-street-lights/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, a large amount of energy is wasted on continuously lighting street lights. In this paper, a scheme has been proposed to automatically control street lights using Arduino microcontroller and switch on lights only when an activity is observed in the road. Also, a scheme has been discussed to generate power and run our automated model using Piezoelectric transducers. Additionally, it is shown how this system can be used for other purposes like traffic monitoring, weather monitoring and fault checking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the proposed system, the developing countries can be more efficient with their electrical energy as well as the maintenance cost of power lines for street lights. It also reduces the manual work to zero. Automatic Smart Light System is a very user friendly approach and the usage of this smart light system will help in saving large amount of power in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identifying Land Patterns from Satellite Imagery in Amazon Rainforest using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/project/identify-land-pattern-keras/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2018 23:52:39 +0530</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Amazon rainforests have been suffering widespread damage, both via natural and artificial means. Every minute, it is estimated that the world loses forest cover the size of 48 football fields. Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest has led to drastically reduced biodiversity, loss of habitat, climate change and other biological losses. In this respect, it has become essential to track how the nature of these forests change over time. Image classification using deep learning can help speed up this process by removing the manual task of classifying each image. Here, it is shown how convolutional neural networks can be used to track changes in land patterns in the Amazon rainforests. In this work, a testing accuracy of 96.71% was obtained. This can help governments and other agencies to track changes in land patterns more effectively and accurately.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A statistical approach to predict flight delay using gradient boosted decision tree</title>
      <link>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/project/flight-delay/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Jun 2017 01:18:50 +0530</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Supervised machine learning algorithms have been used extensively in different domains of machine learning like pattern recognition, data mining and machine translation. Similarly, there has been several attempts to apply the various supervised or unsupervised machine learning algorithms to the analysis of air traffic data. However, no attempts have been made to apply Gradient Boosted Decision Tree, one of the famous machine learning tools to analyse those air traffic data. This paper investigates the effectiveness of this successful paradigm in the air traffic delay prediction tasks. By combining this regression model based on the machine learning paradigm, an accurate and sturdy prediction model has been built which enables an elaborated analysis of the patterns in air traffic delays. Gradient Boosted Decision Tree has shown a great accuracy in modeling sequential data. With the help of this model, day-to-day sequences of the departure and arrival flight delays of an individual airport can be predicted efficiently. In this paper, the model has been implemented on the Passenger Flight on-time Performance data taken from U.S. Department of Transportation to predict the arrival and departure delays in flights. It shows better accuracy as compared to other methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the insights obtained.&lt;/p&gt;
