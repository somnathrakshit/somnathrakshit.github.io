I spent a lot of time today thinking about what to write here. After some time, I decided it wasn’t worthwhile to think beforehand about it. Maybe, the best way to go about it is to write about something new that I learned. So, this will blog will have no fixed topic. I will write about anything interesting that I learn. Be it technology, general knowledge or whatever, I will write about it if I find it to be interesting (and of course, I get some free time as well :P).

So, here’s to this blog. May it succeed.
