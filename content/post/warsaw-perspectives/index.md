## City
I have been living in Warsaw since 15th February of this year. During these past few months, I have been able to gain some insight into this city and its people. Firstly, this was my first experience of an European city. Frankly, this was an welcoming change from the huge cities that we are accustomed to in India. I came to know from many people here that most European cities are walk-able, something which we can only dream of in the big Indian cities. Apart from this, I have noticed that people honk rarely. During my stay here since the past three and a half months, I have heard the sound of horn less than ten times. I am sure that in Kolkata, it would take me ten minutes on a busy day to cross that number. 

## Food
Talking of food, potato is the staple food here. To imagine the scale of this, consider replacing rice from your daily meal with boiled potatoes. This is exactly what happens here. However, rice is available at almost all shops. Indian spices are tougher to get but there are a few South Asian shops who sell them. All said, Polish food is usually good with less oil and salt, making it generally healthy. 

## Language
Language is a real barrier in Poland. Polish is one of the toughest languages to learn for a beginner. The struggle is real because very few people speak English here. However, the younger generation, in general, can communicate in English. It is almost imperative to learn a few of the most used Polish words in order to navigate day-to-day life here. But the Polish people are helpful and kind. It makes them happy to see foreigners being able to speak their language.

## Transportation
Publis transport is highly efficient in Warsaw. The entire city is well-connected by means of buses, metro and trams. All of these forms of transport are run by a single company and hence, you only need to buy a single ticket to access any of these throughout the city. Apart from the 20 and 40 minute passes, long-term passes like daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly passes are available which offer unlimited rides during their valid period. Public transportation is extremely punctual here. There is an Android as well as a Web app named Jakdojade which shows timings of all three forms of transport here. Roads have dedicated bus-lanes for convenience of the public. Cycling lanes are aplenty and cycling is highly encouraged here.

## Places to visit
Warsaw is a tourist hostpot. It's Old Town, which was destroyed after the World War II, has been reconstructed to depict the earlier times. This is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Apart from this, there are old churches, musueums and palaces to visit. The Palace of Culture and Science is present at the heart of the city. It was a gift from Stalin to the people of this city. Apart from these, Warsaw is a city of parks. There are numerous parks that act as the lungs of this city. Lazienki Park, Pole Mokotowski, etc. are the most well-known. Many activities take place in the parks during spring and summer seasons.

## Final words
Warsaw is a city that is young in nature as compared to other European cities. It is modern and has all facilities of a developed city. Warsaw is slowly starting to become a tech hub. Currently, it has offices of Google, Facebook and Amazon here. The University of Warsaw is well-known in mathematics and helps in attracting the tech jobs to this city.

At the time of writing, I have less than two weeks before returning to Kolkata. The past few months have been a wonderful learning experience for me. I have been able to meet people of diverse cultures from various parts of the world. I am sure that this experience will be invaluable to me in the upcoming future.
