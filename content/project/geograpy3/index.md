geograpy3 is a fork of [Geograpy2](https://github.com/Corollarium/geograpy2), which is itself a fork of [geograpy](https://github.com/ushahidi/geograpy) and inherits most of it, but solves several problems (such as support for utf8, places names with multiple words, confusion over homonyms etc). Also, geograpy3 is compatible with Python 3, unlike Geography2.

This is installable from PyPi by running the following command.

`pip install geograpy3`
