# geograpy3
[geograpy3](https://github.com/somnathrakshit/geograpy3) extracts place names from a URL or text, and adds context to those names -- for example distinguishing between a country, region or city. It is a fork of [Geograpy2](https://github.com/Corollarium/geograpy2), which is itself a fork of [geograpy](https://github.com/ushahidi/geograpy) and inherits most of it, but solves several problems (such as support for utf8, places names with multiple words, confusion over homonyms etc). Also, geograpy3 is compatible with Python 3.6+, unlike Geography2. This project is under active development by [these people](https://github.com/somnathrakshit/geograpy3/graphs/contributors). This project has been downloaded over 35k times as of Nov 2020.

This is installable from PyPi by running the following command.

`pip install geograpy3`
