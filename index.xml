IR systems have to cater to a variety of users, who may have wildly different mental models of what they consider to be useful and relevant.
Neuro-physiological methods, such as eye-tracking, provide an interesting avenue to observe users while they interact with information systems.</description></item><item><title>Answerability Classification Using Hand-Crafted Features</title><link>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/projects/project-answerability/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/projects/project-answerability/</guid><description>Answerability Classification Using Hand-Crafted Features In this project, I competed with the members in my class on a challenge to predict whether a visual question is answerable or not by using a given image and an associated question in the form of a text. For this task, we were required to create a multi-modal (computer vision + natural language processing) classification system.
First, Microsoft Azure Vision API was used to obtain the tags for each image.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Guide to Sorting in Pandas</title><link>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/musings/sorting_in_pandas/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/musings/sorting_in_pandas/</guid><description>A Comprehensive Guide to Sorting in Pandas In order to sort rows in Pandas, you can use the sort_values() function. I have taken examples from this excellant blog. Although it shows a lot of the use cases covered here, the last case is absent pretty much everywhere.
In this tutorial, I will be showing how to use Pandas to sort rows based on different criterion.

It is a fork of Geograpy2, which is itself a fork of geograpy and inherits most of it, but solves several problems (such as support for utf8, places names with multiple words, confusion over homonyms etc). Also, geograpy3 is compatible with Python 3.6+, unlike Geography2.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/contact/</guid><description> Email: firstname at utexas dot edu Mailing Address UTA 5.410,
