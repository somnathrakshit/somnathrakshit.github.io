Its early detection and subsequent treatment can be life saving. However, it is difficult clinically and computationally to detect breast cancer and its subtypes in their early stages.

In this work, we study such NGS based expression data of mRNAs with the clinical data in order to (a) rank the genes based on their importance in survival of breast cancer subtypes and (b) find the relation between the up/down regulation of genes and survival probability of a population. In this regard, first volcano plot is used to find the differentially expressed genes for each subtype, and second, such genes are used to perform the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with the integration of mRNA expression and clinical data to rank the genes by their importance in survival of breast cancer subtypes.

Thus, our goal is to use the Next Generation Sequencing provided high-throughput miRNA expression and clinical data in an integrated fashion to perform survival analysis in order to identify breast cancer subtype specific miRNAs, and analyze associated genes and transcription factors. We select top 100 miRNAs for each of the four subtypes, based on the value of hazard ratio and p-value, thereafter, identify 44 miRNAs that are related to all four subtypes, which we call as 4-star miRNAs. Moreover, 12, 14, 9 and 15 subtype specific, viz. 1-star miRNAs, are also identified. The resulting miRNAs are validated by using machine learning methods to differentiate tumor cases from controls (for 4-star miRNAs), and subtypes (for 1-star miRNAs). The 4-star miRNAs provide 95% average accuracy, while in case of 1-star miRNAs 81% accuracy is achieved for HER2-Enriched. Differences in expression of miRNAs between cancer stages is also analyzed, and a subset of 8 miRNAs is found, for which expression is increased in stage II relative to stage I, including hsa-miR-10b-5p, which contributes to breast cancer metastasis. Subsequently we prepare regulatory networks in order to identify the interactions among miRNAs, their targeted genes and transcription factors (TFs), that are targeting those miRNAs. In this way, key regulatory circuits are identified, where genes such as TP53, ESR1, BRCA1, MYC and others, that are known to be important genetic factors for the cause of breast cancer, produce transcription factors that target the same genes as well as interact with the selected miRNAs. To provide further biological validation the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks are prepared and KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analysis are performed. Among the enriched pathways many are breast cancer-related, such as PI3K-Akt or p53 signaling pathways, and contain proteins such as TP53, also present in the regulatory networks. Moreover, we find that the genes are enriched in GO terms associated with breast cancer. Our results provide detailed analysis of selected miRNAs and their regulatory networks.","tags":[],"title":"Identification of Breast Cancer subtype specific MicroRNAs using Survival Analysis to find their role in transcriptomic regulation ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Indrajit Saha","Somnath Rakshit","Michal Wlasnowolski","Dariusz Plewczynski"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564756371,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564756371,"objectID":"a8b6ab3ac3120c307cfa887385846107","permalink":"https://somnathrakshit.github.io/publication/epigenetics-tencon2019/","publishdate":"2019-08-02T20:02:51+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/epigenetics-tencon2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Breast cancer is one of the most deadly cancers. It has four subtypes: Luminal A (LA), Luminal B (LB),  HER2-enriched (HER2-E) and Basal-like (BL). For the cause of breast cancer subtypes, there are different genetic and epigenetic factors involved in its progression and susceptibility. Thus, the identification of genetic and/or epigenetic biomarkers can be helpful to understand the biological mechanisms better and to improve the diagnostic processes of this disease and its subtypes. Hence, this fact motivated us to investigate the epigenetic factor, such as DNA Methylation, with the integration of gene expression in order to find epigenetic biomarkers for breast cancer subtypes. In this regard, first, we identified set of up and down regulated genes for each subtype using differential analysis. Thereafter, regression based feature ranking problem is formed in order to find the DNA Methylation site that is mostly responsible for the change in expression of a gene, which is considered as an epigenetic biomarker. A bagging integrated ensemble of decision trees is used for the same. The results of top ten up and down regulated genes and their corresponding most significant DNA Methylation sites are reported for breast cancer subtypes. Moreover, these genes are validated visually by means of survival and expression plots, showing TF-Gene-DNA Methylation interactions, Protein-Protein interaction network, KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analysis. The results show that top differentially expressed up and down regulated genes viz. MMP11, NUF2, EXO1, HJURP,  HOXA4, SYNM, CAV1 and COL4A3BP in breast cancer subtypes may change their expression because of DNA Methylation sites viz. cg22418565, cg26029744, cg24741598, cg04550103, cg25952581, cg02109162, cg18498156 and cg04985097 respectively.","tags":["computational biology"],"title":"Identification of Epigenetic Biomarkers with the use of Gene Expression and DNA Methylation for Breast Cancer Subtypes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Namrata Pant","Somnath Rakshit","Sushmita Paul","Indrajit Saha"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564067446,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564067446,"objectID":"57dfa9658c1d440cd3525fb263c60c3b","permalink":"https://somnathrakshit.github.io/publication/multi-view-mirna-stad/","publishdate":"2019-07-25T20:40:46+05:30","relpermalink":"/publication/multi-view-mirna-stad/","section":"publication","summary":"Stomach cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. More than 80% diagnosis of this cancer occur at later stages leading to low 5-year survival rate. This emphasizes the need to have better prognostic techniques for stomach cancer. In this regard, the Next-Generation Sequencing of whole genome and multi-view approach to omics may reveal the underlying molecular complexity of stomach cancer using high throughput expression data of miRNA. Generally, miRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs, which cause downregulation of target mRNAs. They also show differential expression for a specific biological condition like stage or histological type of stomach cancer, highlighting their importance as potential biomarkers. Analyzing miRNA expression data is a challenging task due to the existence of large number of miRNAs and less sample size. A small set of miRNAs will be helpful in designing efficient diagnostic and prognostic tool. In this regard, here a computational framework is proposed that selects different sets of miRNAs for five different categories of clinical outcomes viz. condition, clinical stage, age, histological type, and survival status. First, the miRNAs are ranked using four feature ranking methods. These ranks are used to find an ensemble rank based on adaptive weight. Second, the top 100 miRNAs from each category are used to find the miRNAs that are common to all categories as well as miRNAs that belong to only one category. Finally, the results have been validated quantitatively and through biological significance analysis.","tags":["computational biology"],"title":"Genome-wide Analysis of Multi-View Data of miRNA-seq to Identify miRNA Biomarkers for Stomach Cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Somnath Rakshit"],"categories":["programming"],"content":" In order to sort rows in Pandas, you can use the sort_values() function.

But we can change it easily, as will be shown later.\ndf.sort_values(by=['Brand'], inplace=True)  df   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }    Brand Price Year     3 Audi A4 35000 2018   2 Ford Focus 27000 2018   0 Honda Civic 22000 2015   1 Toyota Corolla 25000 2013     The complete code to perform the task above is shown below.\nfrom pandas import DataFrame Cars = {'Brand': ['Honda Civic','Toyota Corolla','Ford Focus','Audi A4'], 'Price': [22000,25000,27000,35000], 'Year': [2015,2013,2018,2018] } df = DataFrame(Cars, columns= ['Brand', 'Price','Year']) # sort Brand - ascending order df.sort_values(by=['Brand'], inplace=True) df   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }    Brand Price Year     3 Audi A4 35000 2018   2 Ford Focus 27000 2018   0 Honda Civic 22000 2015   1 Toyota Corolla 25000 2013     Column in an descending order Now, suppose we would like to sort df in descending order. Well, sort_values() accepts a paramter named ascending. By passing ascending=True, you can sort the df in descending order. The code is given below.\ndf.sort_values(by=['Brand'], inplace=True, ascending=False)  # sort - descending order from pandas import DataFrame Cars = {'Brand': ['Honda Civic','Toyota Corolla','Ford Focus','Audi A4'], 'Price': [22000,25000,27000,35000], 'Year': [2015,2013,2018,2018] } df = DataFrame(Cars, columns= ['Brand', 'Price','Year']) # sort Brand - descending order df.sort_values(by=['Brand'], inplace=True, ascending=False) df   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }    Brand Price Year     1 Toyota Corolla 25000 2013   0 Honda Civic 22000 2015   2 Ford Focus 27000 2018   3 Audi A4 35000 2018     By multiple columns - Same data type In the next step, we would like to sort based on two columns. So, here, we first sort by Year and then by the Price of the car. sort_values() accepts a parameter called by. The by paramters can accept a string literal or it can accept a list. We simply need to pass the list containing the columns by which we want the df to be sorted. This is shown below.\n df.sort_values(by=['Year','Price'], inplace=True)  # sort by multiple columns from pandas import DataFrame Cars = {'Brand': ['Honda Civic','Toyota Corolla','Ford Focus','Audi A4'], 'Price': [22000,25000,27000,35000], 'Year': [2015,2013,2018,2018] } df = DataFrame(Cars, columns= ['Brand', 'Price','Year']) # sort by multiple columns: Year and Price df.sort_values(by=['Year','Price'], inplace=True) df   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }    Brand Price Year     1 Toyota Corolla 25000 2013   0 Honda Civic 22000 2015   2 Ford Focus 27000 2018   3 Audi A4 35000 2018     By multiple columns - Mixed data type It is also possible to pass mixed type of columns to be sorted. For example, we can pass the Year column (integer) and the Brand column (string). Pandas accepts this without any problem.\ndf.sort_values(by=['Year','Brand'], inplace=True)  # sort by multiple columns from pandas import DataFrame Cars = {'Brand': ['Honda Civic','Toyota Corolla','Ford Focus','Audi A4'], 'Price': [22000,25000,27000,35000], 'Year': [2015,2013,2018,2018] } df = DataFrame(Cars, columns= ['Brand', 'Price','Year']) # sort by multiple columns: Year and Brand df.sort_values(by=['Year','Brand'], inplace=True) df   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }    Brand Price Year     1 Toyota Corolla 25000 2013   0 Honda Civic 22000 2015   3 Audi A4 35000 2018   2 Ford Focus 27000 2018     By multiple columns and mixed order Last but not the least, it is also possible to sort multiple columns in mixed order. For example, we may want to sort by Year and Brand where the Year column needs to be sorted in descending order whereas the Brand column needs to be sorted in ascening order. Pandas performs this by accepting list in addition to a boolean variable to the ascending parameter. The correct intuitive way of doing this is shown below.\ndf.sort_values(by=['Year','Brand'], ascending=[False, True], inplace=True)  # sort by multiple columns but different order from pandas import DataFrame Cars = {'Brand': ['Honda Civic','Toyota Corolla','Ford Focus','Audi A4'], 'Price': [22000,25000,27000,35000], 'Year': [2015,2013,2018,2018] } df = DataFrame(Cars, columns= ['Brand', 'Price','Year']) # sort by multiple columns: Year and Brand df.sort_values(by=['Year','Brand'], ascending=[False, True], inplace=True) df   .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; }    Brand Price Year     3 Audi A4 35000 2018   2 Ford Focus 27000 2018   0 Honda Civic 22000 2015   1 Toyota Corolla 25000 2013     You can know more about sorting in Pandas by visiting the official documentation.\n","date":1559386376,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559386376,"objectID":"f9c504d38fd3a67272e267ca1916eb57","permalink":"https://somnathrakshit.github.io/post/sorting_in_pandas/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T12:52:56+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/sorting_in_pandas/","section":"post","summary":"In order to sort rows in Pandas, you can use the sort_values() function.

During these past few months, I have been able to gain some insight into this city and its people. Firstly, this was my first experience of an European city. Frankly, this was an welcoming change from the huge cities that we are accustomed to in India. I came to know from many people here that most European cities are walk-able, something which we can only dream of in the big Indian cities. Apart from this, I have noticed that people honk rarely. During my stay here since the past three and a half months, I have heard the sound of horn less than ten times. I am sure that in Kolkata, it would take me ten minutes on a busy day to cross that number.\nFood Talking of food, potato is the staple food here. To imagine the scale of this, consider replacing rice from your daily meal with boiled potatoes. This is exactly what happens here. However, rice is available at almost all shops. Indian spices are tougher to get but there are a few South Asian shops who sell them. All said, Polish food is usually good with less oil and salt, making it generally healthy.\nLanguage Language is a real barrier in Poland. Polish is one of the toughest languages to learn for a beginner. The struggle is real because very few people speak English here. However, the younger generation, in general, can communicate in English. It is almost imperative to learn a few of the most used Polish words in order to navigate day-to-day life here. But the Polish people are helpful and kind. It makes them happy to see foreigners being able to speak their language.\nTransportation Publis transport is highly efficient in Warsaw. The entire city is well-connected by means of buses, metro and trams. All of these forms of transport are run by a single company and hence, you only need to buy a single ticket to access any of these throughout the city. Apart from the 20 and 40 minute passes, long-term passes like daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly passes are available which offer unlimited rides during their valid period. Public transportation is extremely punctual here. There is an Android as well as a Web app named Jakdojade which shows timings of all three forms of transport here. Roads have dedicated bus-lanes for convenience of the public. Cycling lanes are aplenty and cycling is highly encouraged here.\nPlaces to visit Warsaw is a tourist hostpot. It\u0026rsquo;s Old Town, which was destroyed after the World War II, has been reconstructed to depict the earlier times. This is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Apart from this, there are old churches, musueums and palaces to visit. The Palace of Culture and Science is present at the heart of the city. It was a gift from Stalin to the people of this city. Apart from these, Warsaw is a city of parks. There are numerous parks that act as the lungs of this city. Lazienki Park, Pole Mokotowski, etc. are the most well-known. Many activities take place in the parks during spring and summer seasons.\nFinal words Warsaw is a city that is young in nature as compared to other European cities. It is modern and has all facilities of a developed city. Warsaw is slowly starting to become a tech hub. Currently, it has offices of Google, Facebook and Amazon here. The University of Warsaw is well-known in mathematics and helps in attracting the tech jobs to this city.\nAt the time of writing, I have less than two weeks before returning to Kolkata. The past few months have been a wonderful learning experience for me. I have been able to meet people of diverse cultures from various parts of the world. I am sure that this experience will be invaluable to me in the upcoming future.                 \n","date":1559350012,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559350012,"objectID":"2aa573d743d020c8fb363e3b60dba1c5","permalink":"https://somnathrakshit.github.io/post/warsaw-perspectives/","publishdate":"2019-06-01T02:46:52+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/warsaw-perspectives/","section":"post","summary":"City I have been living in Warsaw since 15th February of this year.

Thus, in this article, we propose a novel wrapper based feature selection technique with the integration of Rough and Fuzzy sets, Random Forest and Particle Swarm Optimization, to identify putative miRNAs that can solve the underlying biological problem effectively, i.e. to separate tumour and control samples. Here, Rough and Fuzzy sets help to address the vagueness and overlapping characteristics of the dataset while performing clustering. On the other hand, Random Forest is applied to perform the classification task on the clustering results to yield better solutions. The integrated clustering and classification tasks are considered as an underlying optimization problem for Particle Swarm Optimization method where particles encode features, in this case, miRNAs. The performance of the proposed wrapper based method has been demonstrated quantitatively and visually on next-generation sequencing data of breast cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

Currently, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) of genome has revolutionized stomach cancer research by providing multi-view data which can be used for better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism of this disease. Micro-RNA (miRNA) sequencing data is one such high resolution expression data. MiRNAs are evolutionary conserved, small, non-coding RNAs that play a role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. They are proven to show abnormal expression for a specific biological condition like tumor or age or survival of stomach cancer which makes them potential biomarkers for this cancer type. MiRNA data analysis comes with a challenge of less number of samples as compared to the number of miRNAs. Finding a small set of miRNAs is needed to identify potential biomarkers. In this regard, here, a method for selecting a small subset of miRNAs from the entire miRNA expression data has been proposed that selects miRNAs, common to three different categories of clinical outcomes, viz. condition, age, and survival status. First, three feature selection methods have been used to rank miRNAs individually for different categories. These ranks are then used to compute an ensemble of ranks of each miRNA using adaptive weight method for each category. Second, the top 100 miRNAs from each category have been used to find the miRNAs that are common to all categories. As a result, four miRNAs are found which are validated using classification of subclass under each category, miRNA-Gene-TF network, PPI network, expression analysis using box plots, KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analysis.","tags":["computational-biology","python"],"title":"Identification of Four miRNAs by Analysing Multi-View miRNA-seq Data of Stomach Cancer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Somnath Rakshit","Indrajit Saha","Michal Wlasnowolski","Ujjwal Maulik","Dariusz Plewczynski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552694350,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552694350,"objectID":"605cb73d9668b8ff0b854cbb85afb96b","permalink":"https://somnathrakshit.github.io/publication/chexray/","publishdate":"2019-03-16T01:59:10+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chexray/","section":"publication","summary":"Classification of diseases from biomedical images is a fast growing emerging field of research. In this regard, chest X-Rays (CXR) are one of the most widely used medical images to diagnose common heart and lung diseases where previous works have explored the usage of various pre-trained deep learning models to perform the classification. However, these models are very deep, thus use large number of parameters. Moreover, it is still not possible to find readily available access to a practicing radiologist for proper diagnosis from an X-Ray image of chest. Hence, this fact motivated us to conduct this research with the aim to classify CXR images in an automated manner with smaller number of parameters during training for 14 different categories of thoracic diseases and produce heatmap for the corresponding image in order to show the location of abnormality. For the purpose of classification, transfer learning is used with the pre-trained network of Resnet18, while the heatmaps are generated using pooling along the channel dimension and then computing the average of class-wise features. The proposed model contains less parameters to train and provides better performance than the other models present in the literature. The trained model is then validated both quantitatively and visually by producing localized images in the form of heatmaps of the CXR images. Moreover, the dataset and code of this work are provided online.","tags":["deep learning","computer vision"],"title":"Deep Learning for Detection and Localization of Thoracic Diseases using Chest X-Ray Imagery","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Soumik Ranjan Dasgupta","Somnath Rakshit","Dipak K.

In a tropical country like India, potato is one of the major staple food that is eaten throughout the year. Recently the production of potato is falling short due to various diseases like Early Blight and Late Blight which cause a huge loss of the cropped plants. This also leads to a major loss in the national economy as well. The emergence of deep learning has affected many fields of machine learning research. Since it is not required in deep learning to develop hand-crafted features, it has found widespread adoption in the scientific community. To tackle the need for a huge amount of data for deep learning, another heavily implemented technique is used, namely, transfer learning, to make the training process faster and more accurate with a relatively small dataset at hand. The performance of the model is demonstrated both quantitatively by computing the accuracy metric as well as visually. The model is lightweight and robust and thus can be added to an application in a handheld device like smartphone so that crop growers could spot the disease affected crops on the go and save them from getting ruined.","tags":["deep learning","computer vision"],"title":"Detection of Diseases in Potato Leaves using Transfer Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Somnath Rakshit","Subha Shankar Chakraborty","Indrajit Saha","Dariusz Plewczynski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1540941795,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540941795,"objectID":"f9fde30040d9d76d8dc72e6c76e42e1c","permalink":"https://somnathrakshit.github.io/publication/breast-cancer-integrated-sae/","publishdate":"2018-10-31T01:23:15+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/breast-cancer-integrated-sae/","section":"publication","summary":"In this work, it is seen that deep learning technique such as stacked autoencoder can be useful in reducing the dimension of a high dimensional multi-omics data.

The presence of hemorrhage is one of the earliest signs to indicate the severity of the disease. In this paper we review techniques, algorithms and methodologies used for the detection of hemorrhage from diabetic retinopathy retinal images. The retina is a transparent layer of vascularized neural tissue lining the inner layer of the back wall of the eye, between the retinal pigment epithelium on the outer and the vitreous on the inner side. The retina captures photons and converts these two photochemical and electrical energy integrates the Signals and transmits the resultant signal to the visual cortex of the brain via the optic nerve tracts and radiations. The retinal architecture is lamellar. Within this there are major types performing sensory nutritional regulatory immunomodulatory and structure and functions. The retina is uniquely partitioned from the vascular system by the blood retinal barrier and blood aqueous barrier. The blood supply is dual to the inner retina it is by the retinal circulation lying within the in a retina and to the outer retina it is by the choroidal circulation, Hrithik vascular layer lying outside of the retinal pigment epithelium. The retinal pigment epithelium and the choroid are critical to retinal function. Is the eye is imagined to be a camera in the retina is the film. Just like a picture cannot be developed if the camera has defective film, vision is not possible in an eye with a defective retina.\nIf caught early then diabetic retinopathy can be treated, otherwise it can lead to irreversible blindness. Unluckily, medical specialists capable of detecting the disease are not available in many parts of the world where diabetes is prevalent. Deep neural networks have helped in solving many such problems in the recent past. Medical image classification has been done accurately using deep neural networks and thus, we will be using this in our project. The aim of this project is to use deep learning to help doctors identify the patients in need, particularly among underserved populations.\nProlonged diabetes leads to DR, where the retina is damaged due to fluid leaking from the blood vessels. Usually, the stage of DR is judged based on blood vessels, exudes, hemorrhages, microaneurysms and texture. In this paper, we have discussed different methods for features extraction and automatic DR stage detection. An ophthalmologist uses an ophthalmoscope to visualize the blood vessels and his or her brain to detect the DR stages. Recently digital imaging became available as a tool for DR screening. It provides high quality permanent records of the retinal appearance, which can be used for monitoring of progression or response to treatment, and which can be reviewed by an ophthalmologist, digital images have the potential to be processed by automatic analysis systems. A combination of both accurate and early diagnosis as well as correct application of treatment can prevent blindness caused by DR in more than 50% of all cases. Therefore, regular screenings for DR of patients with diabetes is important. The grading of the resultant fundus images is an important cost factor. Automated DR detection can reduce the grading cost and thereby make the whole screening process less expensive. Some of the algorithms and systems reviewed in this paper are close to achieve DR identification in clinical practice.\n","date":1526327486,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1526327486,"objectID":"7bcde0fda18c4b1989a4e1aa5a5fbf91","permalink":"https://somnathrakshit.github.io/project/fundus-image-localization/","publishdate":"2018-05-15T01:21:26+05:30","relpermalink":"/project/fundus-image-localization/","section":"project","summary":"Automated classification and localization of diabetic retinopathy was performed using Keras in fundus images.
