&lt;p>Implemented the neural style transfer algortihm implemented by Gatys et al. (2016) in PyTorch. This technique allows us to take an input image and perform its reproduction in a new artistic style. This algorithm takes two images as inputs. One is the style image that contains the artistic style whereas the other image contains the content which is to be modified in the given artistic style.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Identifying Land Patterns from Satellite Imagery in Amazon Rainforest using Deep Learning</title><link>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/project/identify-land-pattern-keras/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2018 23:52:39 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/project/identify-land-pattern-keras/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Amazon rainforests have been suffering widespread damage, both via natural and artificial means. Every minute, it is estimated that the world loses forest cover the size of 48 football fields. Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest has led to drastically reduced biodiversity, loss of habitat, climate change and other biological losses. In this respect, it has become essential to track how the nature of these forests change over time. Image classification using deep learning can help speed up this process by removing the manual task of classifying each image. Here, it is shown how convolutional neural networks can be used to track changes in land patterns in the Amazon rainforests. In this work, a testing accuracy of 96.71% was obtained. This can help governments and other agencies to track changes in land patterns more effectively and accurately.&lt;/p>
