For this task, we were required to create a multi-modal (computer vision + natural language processing) classification system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft Azure Vision API has been used to obtain the tags for each image. They have been joined together with space character in between to create artifical sentence. Then, the TF-IDF representation for these artificially generated sentences are created to be used as features. The TF-IDF representation for the questions have been created as features.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The two TF-IDF matrices are now stacked horizontally to create the unified feature set. We use this as the input dataset for our machine learning model. Random forest model has been used for this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, we see that the dataset is imbalanced. Thus, we try to resample the dataset so that the minority class has equal number of samples as the majority class. We do this by randomly copying the samples. Finally, with this resampled dataset, we once again run a random forest classifier. We see that the results improve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we run Grid Search to find the best hyperparameter for the random forest model and test it on the validation set, which has not been resampled. We see that when the number of estimators is equal to 1000, random forest model performs the best with accuracy metric.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Relevance Prediction from Eye-movements Using Semi-interpretable Convolutional Neural Networks</title><link>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/publication/relevance-prediction-eye-movements-chiir-2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2019 16:16:12 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/publication/relevance-prediction-eye-movements-chiir-2020/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Deep Learning for Detection and Localization of Thoracic Diseases using Chest X-Ray Imagery</title><link>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/publication/chexray/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2019 01:59:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/publication/chexray/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Detection of Diseases in Potato Leaves using Transfer Learning</title><link>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/publication/potato-leaves-transfer-learning/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2019 14:21:24 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/publication/potato-leaves-transfer-learning/</guid><description>&lt;script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/somnathrakshit/22fcb7736e24254940b4216621781681.js">&lt;/script></description></item><item><title>Machine Learning for Object Labelling</title><link>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/publication/oblab2018/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2018 01:23:15 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/publication/oblab2018/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Neural Style Transfer</title><link>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/project/neural-style-transfer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2018 02:32:45 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/project/neural-style-transfer/</guid><description>&lt;p>Google Photos album containing the images is present

&lt;p>Implemented the neural style transfer algortihm implemented by Gatys et al. (2016) in PyTorch. This technique allows us to take an input image and perform its reproduction in a new artistic style. This algorithm takes two images as inputs. One is the style image that contains the artistic style whereas the other image contains the content which is to be modified in the given artistic style.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Identifying Land Patterns from Satellite Imagery in Amazon Rainforest using Deep Learning</title><link>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/project/identify-land-pattern-keras/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2018 23:52:39 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://somnathrakshit.github.io/project/identify-land-pattern-keras/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Amazon rainforests have been suffering widespread damage, both via natural and artificial means. Every minute, it is estimated that the world loses forest cover the size of 48 football fields. Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest has led to drastically reduced biodiversity, loss of habitat, climate change and other biological losses. In this respect, it has become essential to track how the nature of these forests change over time. Image classification using deep learning can help speed up this process by removing the manual task of classifying each image. Here, it is shown how convolutional neural networks can be used to track changes in land patterns in the Amazon rainforests. In this work, a testing accuracy of 96.71% was obtained. This can help governments and other agencies to track changes in land patterns more effectively and accurately.&lt;/p>
